<p><b>Day 40: Pig Latin</b></p>

<p>
Write a function called <b>translate</b> that takes the following words and translate them into pig Latin.
</p>
<p>a = 'I love you'</p>
<p>Here are the rules:</p>
<ol>
	<li>If a word starts with a vowel (a,e,i,o,u) add 'yay' at the end. For example, 'eat' will become 'eatyay'.</li>
	<li>If a word strats with anything other than a vowel, move the first letter to the end and add 'ay' to the end. For example, 'day' become 'ayday'.
</ol>
<p>Your code should return: <b>iyay ovelay ythonpay</b>.
