<p><b>Day 19: Words and Elements</b></p>
<p>Write two functions. The first function is called <b>count_words</b> which takes a string of words and counts how many
words are in the string.</p>
<hr/>

<p>The second function called <b>counr_elements</b> takes a string of words and counts how many elements are in the string.
Do not count the whitespaces. The first function will return the number of words in a string and the second one will return
the number of elements (less whitespace). If you pass "I love learning", the count_words function should return 3 words and 
count_elements should return 13 elements.</p>
