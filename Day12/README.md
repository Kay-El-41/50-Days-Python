<p>Write a function called <b>count_dots</b>. The function takes a strong separated by dots as a parameter and
counts how mnay dots are in the string.</p>

<p><b>Extra Challenge: Your Age in Minutes</b></p>
<p>Write a function called <b>age_in_minutes</b>that tells a user how old they are in minutes.
You code should ask the user to enter their year of birth, and it should return their age in minutes
(by subtracting their year of birth to the current year).
Her are things to look out for:</p>
<p>a. The user can only input a 4-digit year of birth. For example, 1930 is a valid year.
However, entering any number longer or less than 4 digits long should render input invalid.
Notify the user to input a four digit number.</p>
<p>If a user enters a year before 1900, your code should tell the user that input is invalid.
If the user enters the year after the current year, the code should tell the user to input a valid year.</p>
<p>The code should run until the user inputs a valid year. Your function should return the user's age in minutes.
For example, if someone enters 1930, as their year of birth your functoin should return:</p>
<p>You are 48,355,200 minutes old.</p>
