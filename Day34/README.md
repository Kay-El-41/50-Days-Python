<p> "Python was released in 1991 for the first time. Python 2 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehenstions, and a cyber-detecting garbage collection system (in addition to reference counting). Python 3 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible."</p>
