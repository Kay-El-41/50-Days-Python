<p><b>Day 41: Only Words With Vowels</b></p>

<p>
Write a function called <b>words_with_vowels</b> that takes a string of words and return <b>a list</b> of only words that have vowels in them. 
</p>

<p><b>For Example:</b></p>
<p>
'You have no rhythm' should return ['You', 'have', 'no']
</p>

<p><b>Extra Challenge: Class of Cars</b></p>

<p>
Create three classes of three car bands <b>Ford, BMW, Tesla</b>. The attributes of the car's objcet will be, <b>model, color, year, transmission, and whether the car is electric or not (Boolean value) </b>. Consider using inheritance in your answer.
</p>
<p>You will create one object for each car brand</p>
<p> bmw1: model: x6, Color: silver, Year: 2018, Transmission: Auto, Electric: False</p>
<p> tesla1: model: S, Color: beige, Year: 2017, Transmission: Auto, Electric: True</p>
<p>ford1 : model: focus, Color: white, Year: 2020, Transmission: Auto, Electric: False</p>

<p>You will create a <b>class method</b> called <b>print_cars</b> that will be able to print out objects of the class. For example, if you call the method on the <b>ford1</b> object of the Ford class, your function should be able to print out <b>car info</b> in this exact format:</p>
<p>car_model = focus</p>
<p>Color = White</p>
<p>Year = 2020</p>
<p>Transmission = Auto</p>
<p>Electric = False</p>
