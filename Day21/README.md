<p><b>Day 21: List of Tuples</b></p>
<p>Write a function called <b>make_tuples</b> that takes two lists, equal lists, and combine
them into a list of tuples. For example,</p>
<p> if list a is [1, 2, 3, 4] and list b is [5, 6, 7, 8], your code should return</p>
<p> [(1,5), (2,6), (3,7), (4,8)].</p>

<p><b>Extra Challenge: Even Number or Average</b></p>
<p>Write a function called <b>even_or_average</b> that ask a user to input five numbers.
Once the user is done, the code should return the largest even number in the inputted numbers.
If there is no even number in the list, the code should return the average of all the five numbers.</p>
