<p><b>Day 27: Unique Numbers</b></p>

<p>
Write a function called <b>unique_numbers</b> that takes a list of numbers as an argument. Your function is going to find 
all the unique numbers in the list. It will then sum up the unique numbers. You will calculate the difference between the sum of
all the numbers in the original list and sum of unique numbers in the list. If the difference is an odd number, your function
should return the original list. If the difference is an odd number, your function should return a list with unique numbers only.
</p>
<p><b>For Example:</b></p>
<p>e [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8] should return [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8].</p>

<p><b>Extra Challenge: Difference of two lists</b></p>

<p>Write a function called <b>difference</b> that takes two lists as arguments.
This function should return all the elements that are in list a but not in list b and all the elements in list b not in list a.
</p>

<p><b>For Example:</b></p>
<p>list1 = [1,2,4,5,6]</p>
<p>list2 = [1,2,5,7,9]</p>
<p>should return</p>
<p>[4,6,7,9]</p>
<p>Use list comprehension in your function.</p>
