<p><b>Extra Challenge: A Thousand Separator</b></p>
<p>Your new company has a list of figures saved in a list. The issue is that these numbers have <b>no separator</b>.
The numbers are saved in the following format:</p>
<p>[1000000, 2356989, 2354672, 9878098]</p>

<p>You have been asked to write a code that will convert each of the numbers in the list into a string. You code should
then add a comma on each number as a <b>thousand separator</b> for readibility. When you run your code on the list. your 
output should be :</p>
<p>[ '1,000,000', '2,356,989', '2,354,672', '9,878,098’]</p>
<p>Write a function <b>convert_numbers</b> that will take one argument, a list of numbers above.</p>
