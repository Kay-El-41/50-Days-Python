<p><b>Day 21: Add Under_Score</b></p>
<p>Create three functions. The first called **add_hash** takes a string and
adds a hash # between the words. The second function called
**add_underscore** removes the hash (#) and replaces it with an
underscore "_" The third function called **remove_underscore,**
removes the underscore and replaces it with nothing. if you pass
‘Python’ as an argument for the three functions, and you call them at
the same time like:
print(remove_underscore(add_underscore(add_hash('Python'))))
it should return ‘Python’.</p>
