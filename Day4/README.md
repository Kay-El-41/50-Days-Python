<p><b>Day4: Only Floats</b></p>
<p>Write a function called only_floats, which takes two
parameters a and b, and returns 2 if both arguments are floats,
returns 1 if only one argument is a float, and returns 0 ifneither 
argument is a float. If you pass (12.1, 23) as an argument, your
function should return a 1.</p>

<hr/>
<p><b>Extra Challenge: Index of the longest word</b></p>
<p>Write a function called word_index that takes one argument,
a list of strings and returns the index of the longest word in the
list. Ifthere is no longest word (if all the strings are of the same
length), the function should return zero (0). For example, the list
below should return 2.</p>
<p>words1 = ["Hate", "remorse", "vengeance"]</p>
<p>And this list below, shoul return zero (0)</p>
<p></p>words2 = ["Love", "Hate"]</p>
