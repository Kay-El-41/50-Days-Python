<p><b>Day1: Division and Square-Root</b></p>

<p>
Write a function called <b>divide_or_square</b> that takes one argument (a number),
and returns the square root of the number if it is divisible by 5, returns its remainder
it it is not divisible by 5.
</p>

<p><b>For Example:</b></p>
<p>If you pass 10 as an argument, then your function should return 3.16 as the square root.</p>

<hr/>

<p><b>Extra Challenge: Longest Value</b></p>

<p>Write a function called <b>longest_value</b> that takes a dictionary as an argument
and returns the first longest value of the dictionary. For example, the following dictionary should return <b>apple</b>
as the longest value.</p>

<p>fruits = {'fruit':apple, 'color':green}</p>
