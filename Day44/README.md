<p><b>Day 44: Save Emails</b></p>

<p>
Write a function called <b>save_emails</b> that takes no arguments but asks the user to input email, and it saves the emails in a CSV file. The user can input as many emails as they want. Once they hit 'done' the function saves the emails and close the file. Create another function called <b>open_emails</b>. This function opens and reads the content of the CSV file. Each emails must be in its line. Here is an example of how the emails must be saved:
</p>

<p>ii@gmail.com</p>
<p>kate@yahoo.com</p>
<p>and not like this</p>
<p>ii@gmail.comkate@yahoo.com</p>
