<p><b>Extra Challenge: Sort by Last Name</b></p>

<p>You work for a loval school in your area. The school has a list of names of students saved in a list.
The school has asked you to write a program that takes a list of names and sorts them alphabetically. The names
should be sorted by last name. Here is a list of names:
</p>
<p>[‘Beyonce Knowles, ‘Alicia Keys’,‘Katie Perry’,‘ChrisBrown’, 'Tom Cruise’]
</p>
<p>Your code should not just sort them alphabetically, but it should also switch the names (the last name must be the first).
Here is how your code output should look:</p
<p>['Brown Chris', 'Cruise Tom', 'Keys Alicia', 'Perry Katie', 'Knowles Beyonce']</p>
<p>Write a functoin called <b>sorted_names</b></p>
