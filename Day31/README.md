<p><b>Day 31: Longest Word</b></p>

<p>
Write a function called <b>longest_word</b> that has one parameter and takes a list of words as an argument. The function returns the longest
word from the list. The function should return the longest word and the number of letters in that word.
</p>
<p><b>For Example:</b></p>
<p>If you pass [‘Java, ‘JavaScript’, ‘Python’], your code should return [10, JavaScript]</p>

<p><b>Extra Challenge: </b></p>

<p>Write a function called <b>create_user</b>. This function asks the user to enter their name, age, and password. The function
saves this information in a dictionary. For example, if the use enters name as Peter, age - 18 and password - love. The
function should save the information as: {'name': 'Peter', 'age': 18, 'password': 'love'}
Once the information is saved. The function should print to the user that - "User saved. Please login"
The function should then ask the user to re-enter their name and password. If the name and password match with what is
saved in the dictionary, the function should return "Logged in successfully". If the name and password do not match with
what is saved in the dictionary, the function should print ('Wrong password or user name. Please try again'. The
function should keep running until the user enters correct logging details.
