<p>Day 2: Strings to Integers</p>
<p>Write a function called <b>convert_add</b> that takes a list of strings as an
argument and converts it to integers and sums the list.</p>
<p><b>For Example</b></p>
<p>['1','3','5'] should be converted to [1,3,5] and summed to 9.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Extra Challenge: Duplicate Names</p>
<p>Write a function called <b>check_duplicates</b> that takes a list of
strings as an argument. The function should check if the list has
any duplicates. If there are duplicates, the function should return
the duplicates. If there are no duplicates, the function should
return "No duplicates". For example, the list of fruits below
should return apple as a duplicate and list of names should
return "no duplicates"</p>
<p>fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'apple']</p>
<p>names = ['Yoda', 'Moses', 'Joshua', 'Mark']</p>
