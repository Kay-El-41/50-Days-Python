<p><b>Day 33: List Intersection</b></p>

<p>
Write a function called <b>inter_section</b> that takes two lists and finds the intersection (the elements that are present in
both lists). The function should return a tuple of intersections. Use list comprehension in your solution. Use the lists below.
Your function should return (30, 65, 80)
</p>
<p>list1 = [20, 30, 60, 65, 75, 80, 85]</p>
<p>list2 = [42, 30, 8-, 65, 68, 88, 95]</p>

<p><b>Extra Challenge: Set or List</b></p>

<p>You want to implement a code that will search for a number in a range. You have a decision to make whether to store the 
number in a <b>set</b> of a <b>list</b>. Your decision wil be based on time. You have to pick a data type that <b>executes faster</b>.</p>
<p>You have a range, and you can either store it in a <b>set</b> or a <b>list</b> depending on which one executes faster when you are 
searching for <b>a number in a range.</b> See below:
</p>

<p>a = range(10000000)</p>
<p>x = set(a)</p>
<p>y = list(a)</p>

<p>Let's say you are looking for a number 9999999 in the range above. Search for this number in the list and the set. Your
 challenge is to find which code executes faster. You will pick the one that executes quicker, lists, or sets. <b>Run the 
two searches and time them.</b></p>
