<p><b>Day 23: Find the middle</b></p>

<p>
Write a function called <b>middle_figure</b> that takes two parameters a, and b. The two parameters are strings.
The function joins the two strings and finds the middle element. If the combined string has a middle element, the
function should return the element, otherwise, return ‘no middle figure’.
</p>
<p><b>For Example:</b></p>
<p>Use ‘make love’ as an argument for a and ‘not wars’ as an argument for b. Your function should return ‘e’ as the middle
element. Whitespaces should be removed. </p>
