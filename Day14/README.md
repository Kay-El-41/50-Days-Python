<p><b>Extra Challenge: Teacher;s Salary</b></p>
<p>A school asks you to write a program that will calculate teacher's salaries.
The program should ask the user to enter the teacher's name, the number of periods taught in a month,
and the rate per period. The monthly salary is calculated by multiplying the number of periods by the monthly rate.
The currently monthy rate per period is $20. If a teacher has more than 100 periods in a month,
everything above 100 is overtime. Overtime is $25 per period. For example, if a teacher has taught 105 periods, their monthly
gross salary should be 2,125. Write a function called <b>your_salary</b> that calculates a teacher's gross salary.
The function should return the teacher's name, periods taught, and gross salary. Here is how you should format your output:</p>
<br/>
<p>Teacher: John Kelly,</p>
<p>Periods: 105</p>
<p>Gross Salary: 2,125</p>
